About Sojurn
------------

Sojurn keeps track of what TV shows you've watched, and which ones you haven't. It features a backlog so you know what episodes you haven't watched yet, and a timeline that lets you see when your favorite shows will air next. 

You can explore your favorite shows, browsing by season and episode.

It's simple to add new shows or remove ones you don't watch anymore.

To add a show just click the + icon in the top left and a new window appears where you can enter the name of the show and search. Just click the show from the search window and Sojurn adds it to your list of shows, downloads all the images, figures out when it will be on next and much more!

You can view all the seasons and episdoes of a show.
