=============

![alt tag](/images/screenshot1.png)

Sojurn keeps track of what TV shows you've watched, and which ones you haven't. It features a backlog so you know what episodes you haven't watched yet, and a timeline that lets you see when your favorite shows will air next. 



About the code
--------------

Sojurn is written in C# using WPF and MVVM. It uses Caliburn.micro and MahApps.metro.


Requires .NET Framework 4.5.1 or greater.

Data Sources
------------

Currently the data used is from the TVRage API. Sojurn has been written to easily allow the injection of different data sources, so if you'd prefer another feel free to add it.
